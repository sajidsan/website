          <h1>About me? I'm blushing.</h1>
          <p>I’m a product designer at <a href="http://jut.io">Jut</a> working on big data problems with an incredible team. I spend my after hours teaching a brilliant group of students at the <a href="http://www.aaunewmedia.com/learn-2/">Academy of Arts</a> and trying to find people that’ll work on fun side projects with me. Before coming to the Bay area, I studied design research and interaction design at the <a href="http://www.id.iit.edu">IIT Institute of Design</a> in Chicago and worked with the <a href="http://www.studio4designresearch.com">Studio for Design Research</a> in Hong Kong. I've also taught a General Assembly Class on Research + Strategy.
          <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/online/videos/four-design-research-strategies-for-your-next-project">Check it out here</a>. When not dorking out on design, you can find me noodling around in a sketchbook and playing bad hip hop covers on my Casio keyboard.

            I just made <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zNKevDtDBijc.ky0o1S7O3P5Y&usp=sharing">a list of restaurants in SF with drawing paper on their tables</a>.
