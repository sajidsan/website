          <h1>The ID<br>Alumni Network</h1>  
          <p>When I first looking into grad programs for design, running into IIT’s Institute of Design was a happy accident. I was enticed by the programs’ focus on the broad application of design, I kept on running into conflicting messages when doing research on the program. I started poking around to find out more but, even by the time I had decided that it was the right fit, the school still felt pretty mysterious. After getting to the Institute of Design, I realized others felt the same way and I started this project.
