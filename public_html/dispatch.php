          <h1>The Columbus Dispatch</h1>  
          <p>The Columbus Dispatch, a city newspaper wanting to explore what a local newspaper’s future would be in an environment where paper was becoming progressively less relevent in the distribution of information. Our approach was to focus on The Dispatch’s unique capabilities and position, and narrow their possible direction into six digestable opportunity spaces.

        <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-top:40px;">
          <p>Each opportunity space was delineated with problem statements and supported by research. To gauge and gain interest in these directions from stakeholders, these opportunities were presented to members of The Dispatch’s editorial staff in a workshop format.
          </p>
          <p>Members of The Dispatch’s target demographic were also invited to the workshop to help gauge the relevance of each opportunity space.

          <p>Opportunities that garnished the most interest from The Dispatch's stakeholders were then used to ideate additional concepts. These concepts were illustrated in a story board format as well as detailed out with an implementation plan.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>The purpose of these storyboards was to help The Dispatch see how solutions could fit within the lifestyle of members of the Columbus community. They also showed The Dispatch the potential to utilize their strengths and not solely rely on the development of technology.</p>
