		<h3 id="install"><strong>A) Upload/Install Instructions</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>To install this theme, upload the folder titled <strong>Photorific</strong> to your <strong>/wp-content/themes/</strong> directory. Go into your WordPress admin area and under
		<strong>Appearance -> Themes</strong>, select <strong>Photorific</strong>.</p> 

		<hr>

		<h3 id="general"><strong>B) General Options</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>When first setting up this theme, you'll need to most likely visit the General options tab. From here, you can enter your logo URL, background image URL and 404 page text.</p>

		<hr>
        
        <h3 id="img"><strong>C) Background Images/Slideshow</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>Setting The Default Background Image (important)</strong></h4>
        
        <p>When first setting up your website, you will want to set the default background image. This is the image that will be shown on pages/posts/portfolio items that have no custom background image(s) selected.
        To set this, in your WordPress admin area, click on the theme options tab on the left sidebar titled <strong>'Photorific'</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>From here, click the '<strong>Homepage</strong>' tab. In this tab is the option to enter the default background image URL.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Setting Homepage Background Image(s)</strong></h4>
        
        <p>To set the background image(s) for your homepage, on the left sidebar in your WordPress admin, there is a tab for the <strong>'Homepage Slider'</strong>. To add a new image, simply click <strong>'Add New'</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>You can enter any title you want or leave it blank. In the text editor/WYSIWYG enter the URL (only the URL - http://) for the image. Nothing else. If you have any other content in there it will not work so make sure you enter only the URL to the image you want.</p>
        
        <p>Once you've entered the URL, publish and voila, theres your first background image. Of course, to add more just repeat those steps.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Adding Custom Background Images for Posts/Pages</strong></h4>
        
        <p>To add a background image for a page, post or portfolio item, simply choose to upload a file from the 'Background Images' section under the text editor when adding a new post/item. After selecting one, you will have an option to add another. You can add as many as you want.</p>
        
        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When creating a new post/page, there is an option to display the default image or not. If you select yes, this page will just show the one default background image set in the theme options panel.</p>
        
        <p>If you want the custom image/slideshow for that page to show, you will need to select <strong>No</strong> for the <strong>'Use Default Background Image'</strong> option and make sure you have at least one image uploaded.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="nav"><strong>D) Navigation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <p>By default, this theme will automatically add all the pages you've created to the navigation menu. To only include the pages/links you want on the navigation and manage the drop down menu, in the admin area go to <strong>Appearance</strong> -> <strong>Menus</strong>.</p>

	<p>From here, you can create your own custom menu. Follow these steps to add an item to the navigation menu:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Enter the name for your menu where it says <strong>Enter menu name here</strong> - it can be anything</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Create Menu</strong></li>
		<li>On the left under <strong>Theme Locations</strong>, select the menu that you just created and click <strong>Save</strong></li>
		<li>Now you can start adding items to your menu - to add the first one, select the page/portfolio or gallery category/post that you would like to show on the navigation and select <strong>Add to Menu</strong>. Once you've done this, again, click <strong>Save Menu</strong>.</li>
		<li>To enter a custom link (other than pages or categories, use the <strong>Custom Links</strong> section on the left. Enter the URL you would like that link to point to and the title you would like to be displayed under <strong>Label</strong>.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You must click <strong>Save Menu</strong> after you make changes to the navigation.</p>

	<h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Adding Subtext Under Pages For Navigation</h4>

	<p>To add subtext underneath the title of the link on the navigation, simply cick that links arrow, and edit the <strong>Navigation Label</strong>. For the subtext, after the main page title, do a forward slash / and the subtext after that.</p>

	<p><strong>A few examples:</strong></p>

	<blockquote>Home / homepage<br />
	About Us / our story<br />
	Blog / keep updated<br />
	Contact / get in touch<br />
	</blockquote>

        <h3 id="bgimages"><strong>E) Setting Background Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <h4><strong>How To Set The Background Image</strong></h4>
        <p>To enter your background image, go to the theme admin controls page and select the <strong>General</strong> tab, and find the field titled <strong>Background Image URL</strong> - In this field, enter the URL of the background image that you want to use for the homepage and for default on pages that don't have their own image set.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Background Images For Posts/Pages</strong></h4>
        
        <p>When creating a new post or page, there is an option under the text editor for a background image URL. In that field, enter the URL to the background image you want to be displayed on that specific post/page.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="blog"><strong>F) Setting Up The Blog</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <p>This theme utilizes shortcodes to give you more flexibility when creating your blog. To create your blog, create a new page and make sure you've selected the <strong>HTML</strong> tab, and enter this simple shortcode:</p>
        
        <pre>
        [blog max="8" meta="true"]
        </pre>
        
        <p>What this will do, is create a blog with pagination that shows only 8 posts per page (you can set it to whatever you want to of course). The <strong>meta="true"</strong> will just show the post information like who the post was posted by, the date and the comments.</p>
        
        <p>That's it. You can also put your own text or HTML above the shortcode and it will be displayed on each page of the blog.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="portfolio"><strong>G) Setting Up The Portfolio & Gallery</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<h4><strong>Portfolio Page</strong></h4>
        
        <h6><strong>Creating The Portfolio Pages/Categories</strong></h6><br />
        
        <p>To create your portfolio page, navigate to <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>. You can enter any title/content you want although content is not necessary. Select the <strong>Portfolio</strong> template from the list under the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> box and click <strong>Publish</strong>. This page will display ALL of your portfolio items. If you would like to have different portfolio pages with different categories, you first need to create those categories by following the steps below.</p>
        
        <p><strong>If you only want to display your portfolio page with all portfolio & gallery posts/categories listed together and have no need to create/display multiple categories, you do not need to follow any of the following steps.</strong></p>
        
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">------------------------</p>
        <p>To create a new category navigate to <strong>Portfolio > Portfolio Categories</strong> tab.</p>
        
        <p>From here you can create your new portfolio category. Once you've created the category you want, you can then create the items you want to display for that category by following the steps below.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">------------------------</p>
        <h4 style="color:red;"><strong>IMPORTANT!!!</strong></h3>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Once you create a portfolio/gallery category, it is important that you visit the Permalinks page in your admin area. This will make it so when you view a portfolio/gallery category it doesn't return a 404 error. To do this, navigate to <strong>Settings > Permalinks</strong> tab in your WP admin area. Just by visiting this page, you will refresh the permalinks so your category page does not return a 404 error. You need to do this for <strong>BOTH</strong> gallery categories and portfolio categories. So, once you create a category for the portfolio and category for the gallery, you will need to visit the permalinks page for each one and that's it.</p>
        <p>------------------------</p>
        
        <h6><strong>Creating Portfolio Items</strong></h6>
		<p>To add a new portfolio item, click on the <strong>Portfolio > Add New</strong> tab in your admin area.</p>
		
		<p>Enter the title you want and the description that you want to display for that portfolio/gallery item in the title and content box. To set the image for your portfolio/gallery item, on the right sidebar click <strong>Set Featured Image</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>This is the image that will be displayed for this gallery/portfolio item on the portfolio/gallery pages.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Make sure you select the category or categories that you want this item to be displayed in.</p>
        
        <h4><strong>Linking To Different Portfolio Categories</strong></h4>
        
        <p>If you would like to display a certain category in your navigation, simply navigate to <strong>Appearance > Menus</strong> tab. If you haven't already, you need to create a custom menu. You can find out how to do that <a href="#nav">here</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Once you've created the menu, you can add any links that you would like. To display a portfolio or gallery category page, there will be a list of those categories near the bottom of the page that you can easily select and add to the menu.</p>
        
        <p>If you would link to those categories other than using the main theme navigation (like in your pages or anywhere else), you would just need to use the URL of the category. For instance, if you had a category called Photography, and you wanted to link to that category on any pages/posts you create, this would be the code:</p>
        
        <pre>
        &lt;a href="http://www.mysite.com/portfolio/category-slug">Category Name&lt;/a>
        </pre>
        
        <p>To find the slug, navigate to <strong>Portfolio Categories</strong> or <strong>Gallery Categories</strong> (whichever you're using) and on that page it will have a table listing all of the categories you've created, their slugs and how many posts are posted in each category. Simply find the category you want and find the <strong>slug</strong> for that category.
        
        <p>So, if I had say 2 categories named "Web Design" and "Photography", the links would most likely look like (unless otherwise specified):</p>
        
        <pre>
        &lt;a href="http://www.mysite.com/portfolio/<strong>web-design</strong>">Web Design&lt;/a>
        &lt;a href="http://www.mysite.com/portfolio/<strong>photography</strong>">Photography&lt;/a>
        </pre>
  
        <h4><strong>Setting Up The Gallery</strong></h4>
        
        <p>To setup the gallery, follow the exact same steps as above but using the <strong>Gallery</strong> tab instead of the Portfolio tab.</p>

        <h3 id="contact"><strong>H) Setting Up Templates</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
		<h4><strong>Contact Page</strong></h4>
		
		<p>To setup a contact form, create a new page. Select <strong>Contact</strong> or <strong>Contact Left Sidebar</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>This will automatically create a page with an ajax contact form. To setup the email, go into the theme folder <strong>photorific</strong>. Go into the folder called <strong>/js/</strong> and 
		open up <strong>contact.php</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>In that file near the top, it will say:</p>
		
		<pre>
		$email = "email@email.com";
		</pre>
		
		<p>Change that to your email address, save it, and upload it to the <strong>/js/</strong> folder and that's it.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="color"><strong>I) Color Settings</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <p>This theme comes with a color picker so you can easily select the colors you want to use for just about every part of your website.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Header/Main Sidebar Color Settings</strong></h3>
        
        <p>To customize the colors on the header, select the <strong>Header/Main Sidebar Color Settings</strong> tab and choose the colors from there.</p>
        
        <p>You can easily choose colors for the navigation links and sub text, the logo, and the search background + text color.</p>
        
        <h3>Page Color Settings</h3>
        
        <p>To change colors for pages, blog posts, headings, the sidebar, etc, select the <strong>Page Color Settings</strong> tab.</p>
        
        <p>From here, you can change just about every color on the page. You can change the content area background color, text color, heading (h1, h2, h3, etc) colors, link colors and much more.</p>
        
        <hr>
        	
            
        <h3 id="font"><strong>J) Font Settings</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
        
        <p>From the font settings tab, you can choose your own font sizes along with the font you want to use. This font comes preinstalled with 7 cufon fonts for your use. Easily select the font families you want from the drop down menus.</p>
        
        <hr>
            	
		<h3 id="sidebar"><strong>K) Unlimited Sidebars</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme comes with the sidebar generator plugin already installed giving you the option to create as many sidebars as you want and select a certain sidebar for each individual page.</p>
		
		<p>To create a sidebar, click the <strong>Sidebars</strong> link under <strong>Appearance</strong> section in admin area. Click <strong>Add Sidebar</strong>. Enter the name of your sidebar.
		
		Then navigate to the <strong>Widgets</strong> page and your sidebars will be listed there.</p>
		
		<p>To select a custom sidebar for a page, go to your pages section and select the page you want. Scroll down to the very bottom of the page where it says <strong>Sidebars</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>It will say:</p>
		
		<p><strong>Replace</strong> WP Default Sidebar <strong>with</strong> None</p>
		
		<p>Where it says <strong>None</strong>, select the sidebar you want to use, and update the page. That's it!</p>
