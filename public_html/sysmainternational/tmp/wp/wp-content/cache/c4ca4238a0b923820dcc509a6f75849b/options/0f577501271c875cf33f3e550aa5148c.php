There were a couple, but they were either not actual security problems, too small to warrant a release, or just patently false. Remember: just because you read it on a mailing list doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s true. We&#8217;d be the first people to panic if there was an actual problem.</p>
<p>As always, when something serious crosses our desks we jump on it and get a well-tested release out as soon as possible.

We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>
